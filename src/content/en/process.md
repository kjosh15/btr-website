BTR specializes in the upstream and sustaining phases of Sovereign AI—ensuring every build is anchored in strategy. We stay embedded from discovery through scale so strategy becomes a living system, not a static plan.

We work shoulder-to-shoulder with ministries, delivery partners, and frontier model vendors, translating national objectives into specifications that hold up during implementation. Every phase feeds the next, keeping strategy, partners, and delivery aligned.
