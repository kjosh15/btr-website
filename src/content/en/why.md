### The strategic gap

Most governments now recognize the need for AI policy, yet fewer than half have translated ambition into coordinated implementation. Ministries, agencies, and vendors push forward in parallel, but without a shared specification they rarely align.

### The cost of improvisation

Fragmented pilots create technical debt, increase dependency on external vendors, and dilute public trust. Without a living strategic framework, it becomes impossible to scale initiatives or safeguard national data assets.

### Why it matters now

Private-sector adoption continues to compound, widening the capability gap for nations without clear plans. Sovereign AI requires proactive design—context-driven guardrails that ensure every build advances national priorities.
