BTR is led by strategist **[Josh Klein](mailto:josh@josh.is)**, whose work spans national governments, multilateral agencies, and the world’s leading technology institutions. For more than two decades he has translated emerging technology into policy, organisational change, and responsible deployment.

Josh brings together partners across sectors to create sovereign AI frameworks that balance innovation with governance, public trust, and economic value.

We actively coordinate with leading model and cloud partners—including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Cloud, AWS, and NVIDIA—while sustaining long-running relationships with multinational enterprises and agencies such as the CIA, FBI, and ODNI.

> “Our mandate: ensure every nation and institution can design, govern, and benefit from AI on its own terms.”
