## Why Sovereign AI Matters Now

**Heading**
Every nation needs a strategy before it builds.

**Key context**

* Over **120 countries** have published or are drafting AI strategies, yet fewer than half have begun structured implementation (OECD, 2024).
* Only **10% of public-sector AI projects** achieve measurable outcomes without a guiding strategy (World Bank, 2023).
* **Data governance and vendor lock-in** are cited as top risks by **70% of digital ministries** worldwide (UN E-Government Survey, 2024).
* Meanwhile, **private-sector AI adoption** is accelerating, widening the capability gap for nations without coherent frameworks.

**Consequence**
Without a clear strategy, governments risk fragmented deployments, dependency on external vendors, and loss of control over data and decision systems.

**Callout (visual)**

> **Strategy is the system.**
> Pilots should serve strategy—not replace it.

## Our Strategic Process

**Heading**
Turning context into clarity—and clarity into code.

**Intro**
BTR specializes in the upstream and sustaining phases of Sovereign AI—ensuring every build is anchored in strategy.
We remain engaged through validation and adaptation so that strategy becomes a living system, not a static plan.

**Five steps**

1. **Discover** – Map national priorities, governance, and capabilities.
2. **Define** – Translate insight into a strategic specification that guides implementation.
3. **Partner** – Align ministries and vendors to execute collaboratively against the spec.
4. **Validate** – Run tightly scoped pilots to test, prove, and refine strategy.
5. **Sustain** – Evolve and govern AI systems as enduring national assets.

**Quote box**

> “We do pilots to prove strategy—not the other way around.”
